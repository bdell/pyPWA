This is the pythonPWA toolkit.  It contains subpackages to read/write pwa filetypes (.gamp, .bamp, etc.),
represent the various data objects (wave, resonance, etc), perform analysis according to model described
in the paper "On the partial-wave analysis of mesonic resonances decaying to multiparticle final states produced by polarized photons"
by Carlos Salgado and Dennis Weygand, and a few utilities to make working within this topic easier.
